# Pentesting Tool
This tool is a part of a university project. <br>
It is a console app that acts as an interactive high-level shell for multiple encryption/decryption utilities. <br>
You'll be presented with a menu and the app will be waiting for your input. Type the number of the option in the shell that corresponds to the menu option.  
It allows to perform different forms of encryption/decryption:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Base 64 Encoding/Decoding</strong>  
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>File Hashing</strong>: Messages can be hashed with these different methods:
      <ul>
        <li>
          MD5
        </li>
        <li>
          SHA256
        </li>
        <li>
          SHA-1
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hash Cracking:</strong> Using a dictionary attack (you can generate a dictionary using the <code>cewl</code> command or the <code>crunch</code> command.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Symmetric Cipher:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):</strong> A symmetric block cipher. It was the alternative of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was starting to become vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DES (Data Encryption Standard):</strong> A symmetric-key algorithm. It has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography, though nowadays is considered too unsecure for modern use and has subsequently been replaced with the AES. 
        </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Asymmetric Cipher using:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman):</strong> A widely known Public-key cryptosystem
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ElGamal Encryption:</strong> a Public-key cryptosystem based on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm which is based on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithm in a cyclic group.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secure Chatroom app using sockets:</strong> The chatroom has a hybrid Encryption system: The clients exchange keys with the server with a public-key encryption which in turn, the server sends the encrypted secret key to the entering clients. Then clients can obtain the secret key by decrypting it with their private key. Finally they can use that secret key to encrypt messages and send them in a secure way. <br>
  </li>
</ul>  
<h1>Prequisites</h1>
  
This app requires an authenitication with a distant service. For this purpose and to add to the security aspect of the app, I decided to implement a Kerberos-based authentication.
It requires that a Kerberos environment is set and a valid TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is created. Setting up a Kerberos connection is out of the scope of this project.  

The distant Authentication API can be found in the following [Github Repository](https://github.com/YoussefJJ/kerberos-api)

First clone this project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YoussefJJ/pentesting-tool
```
Then enter the directory containing the newly cloned repository

```sh
cd pentesting-tool
```

Secondly, you must install the required packages for the app to run using the following command.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# How to Run the App

Finally, you can run the app with this command.  

```sh
python main.py
```
